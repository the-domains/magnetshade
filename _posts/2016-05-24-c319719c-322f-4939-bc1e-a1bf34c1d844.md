Hello! My name is Jesse Barkasy. I am the father of two boys Christopher and Jack who play a lot of baseball. As a coach I am usually there for the long practice sessions in the hot Sun. I noticed one day while coaching their teams that when the kids practice, the baseball caps protect their heads and face but not their ears and back of their necks from intense Sun rays.I decided to look for something that could attach to their current baseball caps online. 

I found that some of the products came permanently attached to the caps and others looked quite silly. I guessed this was why they did not sell many of these products. I decided to make a product of my own for my boys and also for me so I did not have to look silly and wear a t-shirt on my head while I mowed my lawn in the hot Sun. I soon found out that making a quality product was harder than it looks. I had problems with figuring a way to attach the cloth shade to the baseball cap. One day O went to the dermatologist to check a small mark on my nose. The doctor said I had a non threatening small bit of skin cancer that had to be removed from my nose. That is when for some reason it came to me! "Attach the cloth shade to the cap with magnets!" I had figured a way to secure the shade and not alter the baseball cap! I guess the small skin cancer on my face shocked me into a great idea and into action! Although it was small the surgeon had to make a big cut in my face to pull the skin over the removed area. I had to make this product to help protect peoples ears and necks!

I then went to designers who wanted to charge thousands of dollars even before I made one sale. I really did not want to spend that kind of money because I was not working a full time job at that moment in time. One day I found Meryem. Meryem is from Turkey and she owns a small tailor and seamstress shop in Connecticut. She agreed to make my designs at a certain price for each one made. This way I could test and try each version until I got it right. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/58b89cb1-4ffc-4a64-a152-a890a22ba06d.jpg)

We made about ten versions until one day one of her customers jumped up and said she wanted to buy two of my prototypes for her daughters! This was my first sale and I knew I was near to a salable product. The last step was when my friend Cliff an avid golfer asked to purchase a MagnetShade. He tested it while he was golfing in Arizona and he said it worked well with just a few comments about an attachment issue.

I then quickly found a remedy to the issue and so here I am one year later after many Frankenstein looking prototypes with what I think is a great looking salable product. At least I am at a version of the product that I feel works and looks very good.

Now all I have to do is figure out how to make this website. I will soon be posting more photos and videos as well as an area to order and put payment information once I figure things out in case anyone wants to order my product. Please have a great day and a great week!

<p>Hello! My name is Jesse Barkasy. I am the father of two boys Christopher and Jack who play a lot of baseball. As a coach I am usually there with them for the long practice sessions in the hot Sun. One day while coaching I noticed that when the kids practice, the baseball caps protect their heads and face from the Sun but not their ears and back of their necks. I decided to look for something that could attach to their current baseball caps online. Click on the image above to read more if you do not see the words below!</p><p>I found that some of the products came permanently attached to the caps and others looked quite silly. I guessed this was why they did not sell many of these products. I decided to make a product of my own for my boys and also for me. I wanted something so I did not have to look silly wearing a t-shirt on my head while I mowed my lawn in the hot Sun. I soon found out that making an easy to attach shade that looked good was harder than it looks. I had problems with figuring a way to attach the cloth shade to the baseball cap and with the design. The cap shade slowly progresses with each prototype I made.</p><picture>

<p>I then went to designers who wanted to charge thousands of dollars even before I made one sale. I really did not want to spend that kind of money because I was not working a full time job at that moment in time. One day I found Meryem. Meryem is from Turkey and she owns a small tailor and seamstress shop in Connecticut. She agreed to make my designs at a certain price for each one made. This way I could test and try each version until I got it right. </p><picture>

<p>We made about ten versions until one day one of her customers jumped up and said she wanted to buy two of my prototypes for her daughters! This was my first sale and I knew I had a product that people needed that would sell. The next step I took was when my friend Cliff an avid golfer purchased a MagnetShade from me after I had told him about it. He tested MagnetShade while he was golfing in Arizona and he said it worked well with just a few comments about an attachment issue. </p><picture>

<p>I then quickly found a remedy to the issue and so here I am one year later after many Frankenstein looking prototypes with what I think is a great looking salable product. At least I am at a version of the product that I feel works and looks very good.</p><picture>

<p>Now all I have to do is figure out how to make this website so I can sell this product to customers. I will soon be posting more photos and videos as well as an area to order and put payment information once I figure things for if anyone wants to order my product. I will not be able to sell the sports team fabric MagnetShades until I sell enough where I can afford to get licensing to use it. I contacted Under Armor however they were not interested in my product. I hope they just made a huge mistake by not offering to help me out here and now. I am on my own on a mission to help protect peoples necks and ears from the heat and harmful rays of the Sun. Please have a great day and a great week!</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
